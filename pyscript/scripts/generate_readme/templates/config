# Config specifics
### Config files
All config are seperated to different files located in /config/configurations<br>
Recently I've moved more towards making packages of my different solutions, rather than seperate entity integrations - hence more and more of my configuration will be in /config/configurations/packages

### Automations and scripts
All automations not part of a package are found in /config/automations.yaml and /config/scripts.yaml - all of those a made in Home Assistant GUI.<br>
If a automation or script have been merged as a part of a package, you'll find it in the respective files.

## HACS
I rely heavily on HACS for integrations and lovelace cards.
